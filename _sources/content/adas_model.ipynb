    "# 📈 The Aggregate Demand - Aggregate Supply (AD-AS) Model: A Dynamic View\n",
    "\n",
    "The AD-AS model is a cornerstone of macroeconomics, providing a framework to analyze fluctuations in overall economic activity (Real GDP, $Y$) and the aggregate price level ($P$). It helps us understand how shocks to the economy (like changes in government spending, monetary policy, or supply costs) affect output and inflation in the short run and how the economy adjusts back towards its long-run potential over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive simulation focuses on the **dynamic adjustment** process. We'll see how output and prices evolve period by period when the economy starts away from its long-run equilibrium, driven by the interplay of aggregate demand and the gradual adjustment of prices described by the aggregate supply relationship."

    "# 📉 Aggregate Demand (AD)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Aggregate Demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the overall price level ($P$) and the total quantity of goods and services demanded in an economy (Real GDP, $Y$). It typically slopes downward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simplified model, we represent the AD curve with a linear equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y = a - bP$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Y$: Real GDP (Output)\n",
    "- $P$: Aggregate Price Level\n",
    "- $a$: Autonomous spending component (AD Intercept). This captures factors affecting demand other than the price level (e.g., consumer confidence, government spending, investment sentiment, net exports, money supply effects). A higher $a$ shifts the AD curve to the right.\n",
    "- $b$: Sensitivity of demand to the price level (determines the slope). A larger $b$ means demand is more sensitive to price changes, making the AD curve flatter. This sensitivity arises from effects like:\n",
    "    - **Wealth Effect:** Higher prices reduce the real value of wealth, dampening consumption.\n",
    "    - **Interest Rate Effect:** Higher prices can lead to higher interest rates (if money supply is fixed), reducing investment and consumption.\n",
    "    - **Exchange Rate Effect:** Higher domestic prices can make exports more expensive and imports cheaper, reducing net exports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the sliders for $a$ and $b$ to see how changes in autonomous spending or price sensitivity affect the simulation."

    "# 🏁 Conclusion & Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation demonstrates how the interaction between aggregate demand and a gradual price adjustment mechanism can generate **business cycle dynamics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of the key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shocks:** Changes in the AD parameters ($a$, $b$) or deviations of the initial price level ($P_0$) from the long-run equilibrium price ($P^*$) act as **economic shocks**. These shocks initially move the economy *away* from its potential output ($Y_{\\text{bar}}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adjustment Mechanism:** The economy doesn't stay shocked forever. It gradually adjusts back towards $Y_{\\text{bar}}$ through the following process:\n",
    "    1.  An **output gap** ($Y_{t-1} - Y_{\\text{bar}}$) exists.\n",
    "    2.  This gap causes the **price level to change** in the next period ($P_t \\neq P_{t-1}$) according to the AS dynamics ($\\lambda = 1/c$).\n",
    "    3.  The change in the price level then affects **aggregate demand** in that period ($Y_t = a - bP_t$).\n",
    "    4.  This continues until the output gap closes and prices stabilize.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Adjustment Speed ($c$):** The parameter $c$ (representing price adjustment *inertia*, where $\\lambda = 1/c$ is the *speed*) is crucial.\n",
    "    * A **smaller $c$** (faster adjustment, higher $\\lambda$) leads to a quicker return to $Y_{\\text{bar}}$.\n",
    "    * A **larger $c$** (slower adjustment, lower $\\lambda$) implies more persistent deviations of output from potential – the business cycle fluctuations last longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with the sliders to explore these dynamics! Observe how different parameter values influence:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **path** of output and prices over time.\n",
    "* The **speed of convergence** back to the long-run equilibrium."
