    "# 📘 Measuring GDP: The Expenditure Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the most widely used measure of a nation's total economic output. It represents the **market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period** (usually a quarter or a year).\n",
    "\n",
    "One primary way to calculate GDP is the **expenditure approach**, which sums up the total spending on domestically produced final goods and services."

    "# 🛒 The Expenditure Formula: Y = C + I + G + NX\n",
    "\n",
    "The expenditure approach breaks down GDP ($Y$) into four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Consumption (C):** Spending by households on goods and services. This is typically the largest component of GDP in most developed economies. Examples include spending on food, clothing, rent, cars, haircuts, etc. *(Excludes purchases of new housing, which fall under Investment).*\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Investment (I):** Spending on capital goods, new housing, and inventories. This represents spending that increases the economy's future productive capacity.\n",
    "    * *Business Fixed Investment:* Purchases of new plant, equipment, and software by firms.\n",
    "    * *Residential Fixed Investment:* Purchases of new houses and apartment buildings by households and landlords.\n",
    "    * *Inventory Investment:* The change in firms' inventories of goods. *(Note: This simulation uses 'I' as a single input value).*\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Government Purchases (G):** Spending by federal, state, and local governments on goods and services (e.g., roads, schools, military equipment, government worker salaries). *(Excludes transfer payments like social security or unemployment benefits, as these are not payments for currently produced goods or services).*\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Net Exports (NX):** The value of exports (goods and services sold to other countries) minus the value of imports (goods and services purchased from other countries).\n",
    "    $$NX = \\text{Exports} - \\text{Imports}$$\n",
    "    * Exports are added because they represent domestic production purchased by foreigners.\n",
    "    * Imports are subtracted because C, I, and G include spending on imported goods, which are not part of *domestic* production. Subtracting imports corrects for this. NX can be positive (trade surplus) or negative (trade deficit).\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental national income accounting identity is:\n",
    "$$Y = C + I + G + NX$$\n",
    "This means all the final goods and services produced ($Y$) must be bought by someone (households, firms, government, or foreigners, accounting for imports)."

    "# 📊 Interpreting GDP & Its Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "GDP is a vital measure for tracking economic activity, business cycles, and comparing economic size across countries or time. However, it's important to understand its limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nominal vs. Real:** The calculation here represents *Nominal GDP* if the C, I, G, NX values are in current prices. To compare output over time, we need *Real GDP*, which adjusts for inflation (as explored in other notebooks).\n",
    "* **What's Excluded:** GDP doesn't capture all aspects of economic well-being. It excludes:\n",
    "    * *Non-market activities:* Household production (cooking, cleaning, childcare), volunteer work.\n",
    "    * *Leisure:* The value of time spent not working.\n",
    "    * *Underground economy:* Illegal activities or unreported cash transactions.\n",
    "    * *Environmental quality:* Costs of pollution or resource depletion are often not subtracted.\n",
    "    * *Distribution of income:* GDP doesn't tell us how income is shared among the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, GDP remains a crucial indicator of the scale of market-based economic activity. The simulation below visualizes the contribution of each expenditure component to the total GDP value."
