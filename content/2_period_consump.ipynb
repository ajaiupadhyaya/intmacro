    "\n",
    "## Problem Set 1: Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 1.1\n",
    "An individual has income $y_1 = \\$50,000$ today and expects $y_2 = \\$55,000$ next year. The real interest rate is 5% and Œ≤ = 0.95.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Calculate their lifetime wealth (W)\n",
    "b) Find optimal consumption in both periods\n",
    "c) Determine if they are a saver or borrower\n",
    "d) Calculate their utility level\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 1.1\n",
    "Let's solve this step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Lifetime wealth:\n",
    "   $W = y_1 + \\frac{y_2}{1+r} = 50,000 + \\frac{55,000}{1.05} = \\$102,381$\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Optimal consumption:\n",
    "   * $c_1^* = \\frac{W}{1+\\beta} = \\frac{102,381}{1.95} = \\$52,503$\n",
    "   * $c_2^* = \\beta(1+r)c_1^* = 0.95 \\times 1.05 \\times 52,503 = \\$52,240$\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Saving = $y_1 - c_1^* = 50,000 - 52,503 = -\\$2,503$\n",
    "   They are a borrower (negative saving)\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Utility = $\\ln(52,503) + 0.95\\ln(52,240) = 20.93$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Set 2: Interest Rate Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 2.1\n",
    "Using the same individual from Problem 1.1, how would their optimal consumption change if the interest rate increases to 8%?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 2.1\n",
    "Let's recalculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) New lifetime wealth:\n",
    "   $W_{new} = 50,000 + \\frac{55,000}{1.08} = \\$100,926$\n",
    "\n",
    "b) New optimal consumption:\n",
    "   * $c_1^* = \\frac{100,926}{1.95} = \\$51,757$\n",
    "   * $c_2^* = 0.95 \\times 1.08 \\times 51,757 = \\$53,207$\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher interest rate leads to:\n",
    "- Lower consumption today\n",
    "- Higher consumption tomorrow\n",
    "- Smaller borrowing amount\n",

    "## Problem Set 3: Real-World Application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem 3.1\n",
    "A recent college graduate expects their income to grow from $45,000 to $65,000 next year. With a market interest rate of 6%:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Should they borrow or save?\n",
    "b) How would a recession threat (expecting only $55,000 next year) change their behavior?\n",
    "c) How would student loan payments affect their decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Base case:\n",
    "   * $W = 45,000 + \\frac{65,000}{1.06} = \\$106,321$\n",
    "   * $c_1^* = \\frac{106,321}{2} = \\$53,160$ (assuming Œ≤ = 1)\n",
    "   * Saving = $45,000 - 53,160 = -\\$8,160$\n",
    "   They should borrow to smooth consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) With recession threat:\n",
    "   * $W_{new} = 45,000 + \\frac{55,000}{1.06} = \\$96,887$\n",
    "   * $c_1^* = \\$48,444$\n",
    "   * Saving = $45,000 - 48,444 = -\\$3,444$\n",
    "   Less borrowing due to lower expected future income.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) With $5,000 annual student loan payment:\n",
    "   * Effective $y_1 = 40,000$ and $y_2 = 60,000$\n",
    "   * Similar analysis shows even more pressure to borrow\n",
    "\n",
    "## ü§î Discussion Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why do people sometimes fail to smooth consumption even when theory suggests they should?\n",
    "2. How might uncertainty about future income affect consumption decisions?\n",
    "3. What role do credit constraints play in real-world consumption choices?\n",
    "4. How does the presence of durable goods (like houses or cars) affect the two-period model's predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Data Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the interactive plot above to:\n",
    "1. Recreate the scenarios from the practice problems\n",
    "2. Compare your answers with the model's predictions\n",
    "3. Experiment with different parameter values\n",

    "        - R-squared: {self.results['ols'].rsquared:.3f}\n",

    "        \n",
    "        #### 3. Interpretation:\n",
    "        - A 1 percentage point increase in the interest rate is associated with a {self.results['ols'].params[1]:.3f} percentage point change in the savings rate\n",
    "        - The model explains {self.results['ols'].rsquared*100:.1f}% of the variation in savings rates\n",
    "        - The relationship is {\"statistically significant\" if self.results['ols'].f_pvalue < 0.05 else \"not statistically significant\"} at the 5% level\n",
    "        \n",
    "        #### 4. Rolling Regression Analysis:\n",
