    "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a primary measure of a nation's economic output. However, simply looking at the total dollar value of goods and services produced (Nominal GDP) can be misleading because it's influenced by both changes in the *quantity* of goods produced and changes in their *prices*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the true change in economic output – the actual \"stuff\" being produced – we need to adjust for inflation. This gives us **Real GDP**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation visually demonstrates how Nominal GDP and Real GDP can diverge over time when there is inflation, even if the underlying growth in the money supply (which often drives nominal growth) is constant."

    "# 🧮 Simulation Logic & Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation uses a simplified approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Nominal GDP Growth:** We assume Nominal GDP grows at a constant rate equal to the specified `money_growth` rate. This is a simplification often related to the Quantity Theory of Money ($MV=PY$), where if velocity ($V$) and real output ($Y$) were constant, money supply growth ($M$) would directly translate to nominal GDP ($PY$) growth. In reality, the link is more complex.\n",
    "    $$ \\text{Nominal GDP}_t = \\text{Nominal GDP}_0 \\times (1 + \\text{money\\_growth})^t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Inflation:** We assume a constant `inflation` rate ($\\pi$) over the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Real GDP Calculation:** Real GDP is calculated by deflating Nominal GDP using the assumed inflation rate. Essentially, we are adjusting the nominal value back to what it would be worth in \"base year\" (year 0 in this sim) dollars.\n",
    "    $$ \\text{Real GDP}_t = \\frac{\\text{Nominal GDP}_t}{(1 + \\text{inflation})^t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Implied Real Growth:** The simulation implicitly determines the real GDP growth rate ($g$) based on the difference between nominal growth and inflation:\n",
    "    $$ (1 + g) \\approx \\frac{(1 + \\text{money\\_growth})}{(1 + \\text{inflation})} $$\n",
    "    So, $g \\approx \\text{money\\_growth} - \\text{inflation}$. The simulation calculates and displays this implied real growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot shows how the gap between Nominal GDP (the yellow line) and Real GDP (the green line) widens over time due to the cumulative effect of inflation. The shaded area represents the portion of nominal GDP growth attributable purely to price increases."
