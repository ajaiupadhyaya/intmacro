    "# üìâ Convergence Hypothesis: Do Poor Countries Catch Up?\n",
    "\n",
    "A fundamental question in economic growth is whether poorer countries tend to grow faster than richer countries, leading to a narrowing of income gaps over time. This idea is known as the **convergence hypothesis**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard **Solow growth model**, due to diminishing returns to capital, predicts **conditional convergence**: countries with similar underlying characteristics (like saving rates, population growth rates, and technology levels - i.e., converging to the same steady state) should exhibit convergence. Poorer countries (further below their steady state) will grow faster than richer countries (closer to their steady state).\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing **unconditional convergence** (simply looking if initially poor countries grow faster than initially rich ones, without controlling for other factors) often yields mixed results globally. However, it's a useful starting point to examine the predictions of the basic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simulation generates artificial data for a set of countries to visually test for unconditional convergence by plotting average growth rates against initial income levels."
