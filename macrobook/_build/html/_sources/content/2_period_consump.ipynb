    "\n",
    "Changes in the interest rate $r$ rotate the budget constraint around the **endowment point ($y_1, y_2$)**. A higher interest rate makes the budget line steeper ($slope = -(1+r)$). This change influences the optimal consumption choice through two main channels:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Substitution Effect:** A higher $r$ increases the reward for saving (or the cost of borrowing). Future consumption ($c_2$) becomes relatively cheaper compared to present consumption ($c_1$). This effect *always* pushes the agent to substitute *away* from $c_1$ and *towards* $c_2$ (i.e., save more or borrow less).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Income Effect:** The impact on perceived lifetime wealth depends on whether the agent is a net saver or borrower initially:\n",
    "    * If the agent is a **saver** ($y_1 > c_1^*$), a higher $r$ increases the return on their savings, making them feel wealthier. This positive income effect tends to increase demand for both $c_1$ and $c_2$ (assuming both are normal goods).\n",
    "    * If the agent is a **borrower** ($y_1 < c_1^*$), a higher $r$ increases the cost of their borrowing, making them feel poorer. This negative income effect tends to decrease demand for both $c_1$ and $c_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overall Impact:**\n",
    "    * For **savers**, the effect on $c_1$ is ambiguous: the substitution effect decreases $c_1$, while the income effect increases it. The effect on $c_2$ is unambiguously positive (both effects push towards more $c_2$).\n",
    "    * For **borrowers**, the effect on $c_1$ is unambiguously negative (both substitution and income effects push towards less $c_1$). The effect on $c_2$ is ambiguous (substitution effect increases $c_2$, income effect decreases it).\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Note: With the specific case of log utility used here, the optimal consumption $c_1 = W/(1+\\beta)$ depends on $r$ only through its effect on wealth $W$. Use the interactive plot above and toggle the 'Compare' checkbox to observe how the optimal point shifts as $r$ changes!)*"

    "The two-period model, despite its simplicity, provides powerful insights into the fundamental trade-offs involved in intertemporal decision-making. The interplay between preferences (captured by the utility function and discount factor $\\beta$), opportunities (defined by the budget constraint and interest rate $r$), and income patterns ($y_1, y_2$) determines optimal consumption smoothing and saving behavior. The Euler equation emerges as the key condition ensuring that the marginal value of consuming today is appropriately balanced against the marginal value of saving and consuming tomorrow."
