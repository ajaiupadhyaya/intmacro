    "\n",
    "This site contains a collection of interactive models and explanations built from the course material and readings I found most interesting during my time in **Econ 3020: Intermediate Macroeconomics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use it to explore, learn, and experiment with the models yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project took roughly 100+ hours to get to where it is now, I look forward to expanding upon the models in the future and pushing corrections as I come across them. \n",
    "\n",
    "AI disclaimer: For the sake of my sanity; I ran the entire project through an agent to find issues and correct bugs. This is an entirely self funded/produced project with the help of agents as this is my first time hosting a website, creating economic models, and calling certain libraries necessary for this project. All code and the models themselves are authored by myself. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Click** on any chapter (e.g., *Measuring GDP: The Expenditure Approach*).\n",
    "2. At the top of the page, click the **üöÄ Rocket Icon**.\n",
    "3. A dropdown menu will appear offering:\n",
    "   - **Binder** (Recommended)\n",
    "   - **Colab**\n",
    "   - **Live Code**\n",
    "4. Select a service to open the model interactively:\n",
    "   - **Binder**: Opens in a new tab. It will display *\"Launching your Binder...\"* ‚Äî if it is your first time opening Binder; it is normal for it to take up to 3 min. for it to open the notebook. This varies heavily depending on internet speed, avail. CPU, etc. \n",
    "   - **Colab**: Opens a Google Colab environment with the model loaded.\n",
    "5. **Run the model**:\n",
    "   - In Binder: Click **Run** on each cell.\n",
    "   - In Colab: Click **Runtime** ‚Üí **Run all**.\n",
    "6. **Binder/Collab**\n",
    "   - Once your on Binder or Collab, you can navigate through different models and experiment with different ideas\n",
